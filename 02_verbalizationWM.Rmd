Work by Flavell, Beach, and Chinsky (1966) indicated a change in the spontaneous production of overt verbalization behaviors when comparing young children (age 5-6) to older children (age 10). Despite the critical role that this evidence of a change in verbalization behaviors plays in modern theories of cognitive development and working memory, there has only been one other published near-replication of this work (Keeney, Cannizzo, & Flavell, 1967). This Registered Replication Report relied upon 17 labs who contributed their results to a larger and more comprehensive sample of children (N=980), with roughly equal numbers of 5-, 6-, 7-, and 10-year-olds. We assessed memory performance and the presence or absence of verbalization behaviors of young children across this age range, and determined that the original pattern of findings was largely upheld. We observed a clear increase in verbalization between 5- and 7-year-olds; however, the further increase between 7- and 10-year-olds the Flavell et al. originally reported was much less clear. Verbalization was also more prevalent in the young children in our sample than it was in Flavell et al.'s sample, which seems inconsistent with the proposition that verbal rehearsal strategies are unavailable to children under 7. With our large sample, we were able to extend Flavell et al.'s findings with respect to the benefit of verbalization for recall. Children who verbalized, whatever their age, recalled longer sequences than children who did not. The implications for theories of working memory development arising from these findings will be discussed. 

### How do verbal labels influence children's visual working memory?

Storage of information in visual working memory (WM) is highly constrained and only a limited amount of representations can be maintained vividly in mind. Verbal labeling can be used to improve visual WM. Research with young adults showed that labeling increases both the quantity and quality of the visual information retained in mind, and that adults tend to spontaneously use this strategy. So far, it is unclear whether children can and do use this strategy to improve their visual WM. In this study we aimed to assess developmental changes in verbal labeling effects on the storage of continuous (i.e., fine-grained) and categorical (more prototypical) color information, manipulating whether labeling was spontaneous or experimenter-instructed. Children (5-7 and 8-11 years) and young adults (18-35 years) did a delayed estimation task in which they memorized colored candies varying on a continuous scale. During memorization, they were prompted to remain silent, label the colors, or to say irrelevant syllabi ("bababa") thereby discouraging verbal labeling. At test, the color of the candies was reproduced on a color wheel. Results showed that children of both age groups were able to spontaneously use verbal labels and engage in experimenter-instructed labeling. Across all age groups, experimenter-instructed labeling showed the highest labeling benefit. There was a developmental labeling benefit trend for both spontaneous and experimenter-induced labeling. Mixture modeling on the format (categorical or continuous) in which the colors were stored, and their precision showed that labeling increased both categorical and continuous storage as well as in precision for children over 7-years-old and under 7-years-old, as well as adults. This suggests that experimenter-instructed and spontaneous labeling benefits quantity and quality of visual information similarly across development.

Recent research revealed that working memory (WM) maintenance plays a crucial role in the occurrence of false recognition of semantically related lures (Abadie & Camos, 2018). The present study explores the role of WM maintenance mechanisms, more specifically articulatory rehearsal and attentional refreshing, in false recall of semantic associates. In a Brown-Peterson paradigm, participants maintained lists of four semantically related words while performing a concurrent task. The attentional demand of the concurrent task and the presence of a concurrent articulation during the task were varied orthogonally to manipulate the availability of refreshing and rehearsal, respectively. Then, participants recalled the words immediately after the retention interval and in a delayed task occurring after each block of 10 trials. Results of two experiments provided decisive evidence that preventing the use of rehearsal or of refreshing reduces immediate correct recall. Interestingly, it also specifically increases immediate false recall of unpresented semantic associates with a stronger impact of articulatory suppression. Consistently in the two experiments, there was evidence against an effect of articulatory rehearsal on delayed recall performance. Refreshing also did not affect delayed recall performance in Exp.1. By contrast, in Exp. 2, in which participants were forced to recall the 40 words, i.e., the same number of words as words presented, there was strong evidence that preventing refreshing increased delayed correct recall and had no effect on false recall. These findings support the idea that rehearsal prevents the occurrence of short-term false memories but has no effect in the longer term. Refreshing would also reduce semantic distortions in the short-term, but the results are less clear as to its potential longer-term impact.  

### False memories in children's working memory

Studies indicate that a memory can be distorted after only a few seconds (Atkins & Reuter-Lorenz, 2008). Working memory (WM) maintenance mechanisms seem to determine the occurrence of false memory at short-term (Abadie & Camos, 2018). In this study, we examined this phenomenon by comparing the occurrence of false memories in 4 y.o children, who do not yet use any WM maintenance mechanisms, and 8 y.o children, who spontaneously use maintenance strategies (Oftinger & Camos, 2016).  Children performed a Brown-Peterson task in which they had to memorize semantically related items lists. Then they did an 8-second concurrent task. The difficulty of this task was varied to manipulate maintenance of memory items through WM. Afterwards, children performed a recognition task composed of target items, and of distractors semantically related and unrelated to the memory items. Results provided substantial evidence against an effect of age on correct recognition of targets and indicated that 4 y.o. falsely recognized related distractors as targets more often than 8 y.o. Unfortunately, our manipulation of WM maintenance mechanisms was probably not strong enough to affect children recognition performance. Data were also analyzed with the conjoint recognition model of the Fuzzy-trace theory (Brainerd et al., 1999) to estimate the contribution of gist and verbatim memory to recognition performance. Interestingly, 8 y.o. retrieved more gist and verbatim memory than 4 y.o. These findings suggest that both gist and verbatim memory increase with age which specifically reduce false recognition in working memory. 

### Working memory and language actions: Load effects on quality control in preschool children's production of novel syntax

Working memory is widely accepted as a necessary resource for a wide variety of cognitive abilities. Developmental work has shown that as working memory capacities increase, so too does the ability to successfully perform other cognitive tasks, including language comprehension and production. The present work demonstrates effects of working memory availability on language production. Whereas most of the previous research linking working memory to language development has been correlational, we experimentally varied the working memory load during concurrent language production in children 4-5 years old. Participants (N=36) were asked to repeat verbatim the previously heard, passive-voice descriptions of images displaying transitive-verb actions. These responses were performed while children sometimes retained a spatial-visual or verbal working memory load to be recalled after sentence production. Responses were coded for either maintaining the relatively unfamiliar passive voice of a previously heard description of the picture, or changing the syntax to a more familiar, active voice. Surprisingly, children were more likely to use the active voice when there was no concurrent working memory load. Under a load, children more often used the passive voice, as they were instructed to do, but produced more errors while doing so (including some nonsensical renditions such as the girl was watered by the flower). We propose that working memory, when available, is used to impose a quality-control process whereby the semantic fidelity of the response to the stimulus picture is preserved, here at the expense of disregarding the experimental instruction to reproduce the passive voice.

### Short-term memory for music: the role of the vocal motor system?

Whether people engage in covert rehearsal to maintain musical information in short-term memory (STM) is unclear. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the maintenance of pitch information in STM is supported by the vocal motor system. More precisely, we tested the idea that the rehearsal of pitch information relies on the translation of an auditory target into the motor codes required to reproduce that target. The same sensorimotor translation mechanism is assumed to operate in pitch imitation, and studies on singing abilities showed that the closest from participants' voice is the to-be-imitated the target, the most accurate is their imitation. Consequently, if the vocal motor system supports the maintenance of pitch information in a recognition task for pairs of melodies, we should observe better recognition performance with material sounding with the timbre of a synthetic voice than a piano (Experiment 1) and for melodies with the timbre of a real voice than a synthetic voice (Experiment 2). Also, it is expected that the effect of the type of timbre should disappear under articulatory suppression but not under manual tapping as only the former recruits the vocal motor system. In Experiment 1, we observed no effect of the type of timbre. In Experiment 2, the participants showed an advantage such that recognition was better for melodies with a real voice compared to melodies with a synthetic voice. However, as expected, this advantage disappeared with articulatory suppression. Our results suggest the existence of a link between the vocal motor system and the mechanism involved in pitch maintenance in STM.
